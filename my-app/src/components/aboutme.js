          Hello! My name is Carisse and I am a Full Stack Web Software Engineer
          with an extensive background in Customer Service and Team Building. 
          I took a strong interest to coding after realizing I could learn the
          ability to help others in day to day matters that could make life 
          easier for those who may struggle but on a bigger scale, building 
          something that everyone could use to better their lives! My goal is
          to be apart of something that changes the world for the better and 
          innovates ease in the daily matters of those who are less fortunate. 
          I am excited to be apart of something that creates equality for all.
          If you need to get in touch with me, feel free to talk to me through
          social media or through my email located on my contact form.
        </p>
